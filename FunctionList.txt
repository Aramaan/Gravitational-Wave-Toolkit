Syntax List 

+                add two integers, floats, or strings
-                subtract two integers or floats
**               be able to raise an integer or float to another (3 ** 2 = 9)
not              used in if/else or loops. If x == 2 not 3..... (skips over three into another case)
/                divides two integers                              ( 12 / 6 = 2)
//               division with floats (decimal places)
%   (modulus)    divides two integers and returns the remainder  (12 / 9  returns 3 as the remainder)
and              used in loops and if/else.   If z == 2 and x == 4 : ......... 
or               same as and 

<                less than
<=               less than or equal to 
>                more than
>=               more than or equal to
==               equal to
!=               not equal to

=                assigns a value.  x = 2
+=               adds the right side to the left and reassigns the value to left. a += b is the same as a = a + b
-=               same as above but subtraction
*=               same as above but multipication
/=               same as above but division
//=              same as above but float division
%=

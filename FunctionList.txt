Syntax List 

+                add two integers, floats, or strings
-                subtract two integers or floats
**               raise to the power of ( 3**2 = 9 )
/                divides with floats (includes decimal places)
//               divides with integers (chops off remainder)
%   (modulus)    returns the remainder of a division (34 % 10 = 4)

not              takes the opposite; used in boolean expressions
and              evaluates to true if BOTH conditions are met ( "3==2 and 2==2" evaluates false); used in boolean
or               evaluates to true if AT LEAST ONE condition is met ( "3==2 and 2==2" evaluates true); used in boolean

<                less than
<=               less than or equal to 
>                more than
>=               more than or equal to
==               equal to
!=               not equal to

=                assigns a value.  x = 2
+=               assigns the left side to the SUM of the left and right sides ( a+=2 is the same as a=a+2)
-=               assigns the left side to the DIFFERENCE of the left and right sides (a-=2 is the same as a=a-2)
*=               assigns the left side to the PRODUCT of the left and right sides (a*=2 is the same as a=a*2)
/=               assigns the left side to the QUOTIENT (with decimals) of the left and right sides (a/=2 is the same as a=a/2)
//=              assigns the left side to the QUOTIENT (no decimals) of the left and right sides (a//=2 is the same as a=a//2)
%=               assigns the left side to the MODULUS of the left and right sides (a%=2 is the same as a=a%2)

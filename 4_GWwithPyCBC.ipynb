One such library is `PyCBC`, which is what we will be using in our analysis of gravitational waves.\n\nFirst, we have to install the library. *Optional explanation below.*\n\n\n*The line `!pip install lalsuite pycbc` below will install everything you need. Here is an explanation of what that line means:<br>\n`!` - Tells the Jupyter notebook to switch from Python to shell commands, also known as command-line, which is basically just another (very useful) language.<br>\n`pip` - A program accessed from the shell that will allow us to install stuff.<br>\n`install` - A command for the `pip` program.<br>\n`lalsuite` - The argument that tells `pip` what to install. `lalsuite` is a library that `pycbc` relies on, so we have to install it too.<br>\n`pycbc` - Another argument, that tells `pip` to install this library.<br>*"

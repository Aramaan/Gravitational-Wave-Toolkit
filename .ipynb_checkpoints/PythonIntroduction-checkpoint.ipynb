From minor to major computations, coding is an easy quick way to process lots of data, making it a useful tool to have under ones belt. "

This is where the print function coems into play. The print function allows us to to write something to the console in this direct format  \n\nprint(\" *insert here* \"). \n\nUsing this method, we are able to PRINT what we need. The simplest way to get information. I wonder what would happen if we typed without the print function...\n\nIf i want to say Hello World, \n"

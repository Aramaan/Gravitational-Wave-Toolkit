This allows many people to use it and contribute across many different disciplines. Python is also absurdly high-level, which means many aspects of coding are taken care of behind the scenes, allowing it to read almost like English. Programming is an essential skill for any aspiring physicist, as it greatly increases our capacity to perform computations and data processing in a relatively short amount of time. "

To make it more efficient, programming languages started to introduce *functions*, which are a way to package several commands into one. \n\nLet's take this out of the context of coding. If you want to make a PB&J sandwich, you might put down a piece of bread, then peanut butter, then jelly, then another piece of bread. This could look like the following code:"

Also, a function often ends with a `return` statement, which gives the end result of the function.\n\nThe `+=` sign indicates concantenation, which means adding on to what's already there. If you want more explanation on that or any other symbols, refer to your function cheat sheet.\n\nOnce you define a function, you can \"call\" it later on in your program.

For example, 'try' would have a length of three. Secondly, using brackets returns a specific spot within a string. Since computers begin counting at zero and if `s = 'try'`\n- `s[0]` = 't'\n- `s[1]` = 'r'\n- `s[2]` = 'y'\n\nPutting two numbers (indices) in the brackets, separated by a colon, takes the portion of the word beginning at the first index and ending right before the second index. Thus, `s[1 : len(s) - 1]` chops off the first and last characters of the string. Then we'll pass in the shorter string to test if that portion is also a palindrome. If this is still confusing, skip down to 3.2 Lists for further clarification.\n\nWith these in mind, let's run the function on another word.

If they are not, no more work need be done; the function just returns `False` to indicate the word is not a palindrome. If they are, the function chops off the first and last letters and tries again with the shorter string, until either it finds that it is not a palindrome or the string is only 0 or 1 characters long. If the program gets to the point where the string is 0 or 1 characters long, the string has been confirmed to be a palindrome, and it returns `True`.\n\nFor example, consider the string 'mom'. When 'mom' is passed in to the function, it is first checked to see if it is 0 or 1 characters long. (Every 1-character-long word is a palindrome.) Since it is not, the program continures and checkes if the first and last characters are not equivalent. 'm' and 'm' _are_ equivalent, so the function continues past that conditional. It calls itself, this time with the shorter string 'o'. This string is 0 or 1 characters, so `isPalindrome('o')` returns `True`. `isPalindrome('mom')` returns what `isPalindrome('o')` returns, so we get an answer of `True`.\n\nI hope you both understand what's going on and are able to explain it in layman's terms. Both skills are important for a physicist to be able to build upon others' work and collaborate with other physicists.\n\nNow, a problem for you to tackle."

There a few files of data already in our files, so we'll use those for example. The first thing we need to accomplish is opening our file. When we open a file, we assign it to a variable for manipulation. The main setup of opening a file reads like so:\n\n`variableName = open(\"fileName.type\", \"action\")`\n\nThe actions when opening the file are \n - r       : open the file to read \n - w       : open a new file for writing, if the file you called already exists then it overwrites the data\n - a       : open the file to add data to the end of the file\n - x       : create a new file (only works if the file does not already exist)\n - rb      : open reads the binary data \n - wb      : open writes binary data\n \nIf I wanted to write a new file called Horses, the line of code to so would look like `horses = open(\"Horses.txt\", \"w\")`.\n\nTo read a comma-separated file called countriesofEurope, we'd write `countriesEU = open(\"countriesOfEurope.csv\", \"r\")`."

The action you use to open the file must match the commands you later call on it. Also, we must call `close()` for every file we open, in order to ensure proper processing. Here are a few examples.

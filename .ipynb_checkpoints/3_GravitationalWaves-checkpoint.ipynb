To expand on what Amber said, space time is defined as the combination of the three dimensions of space and time into a singlular four-dimensional array. With this is mind, gravitational waves are ripples within space-time. These ripples can be felt throughout space by any object affected by gravity. If you have a piece of plastic wrap stretched out and put a marble and a piece of celery on, they would both make dents. Because the marble has more mass than the celery, it creates more tension on the plastic wrap than the celery. The marble pulls the celery closer to it, sending ripples through the wrap until the marble and celery are in the same dent. The ripples sent out through the plastic wrap, tell us where the marble and celery lie and when they become one. This is the concept on gravitational waves. \n"

On the planet, multiple detectors exist to be able to tell if it is a gravitational wave signal or background noise. Another benefit of having multiple detectors on at the same time is a new way to detect objects further in space. As gravitational waves travel, they get disrupted by objects they travel through. This allows us to 'see' objects we cant physically look at with telescopes; we are able to see through the data."

According to Lorentz transformations (state of measurements in special relativity), gravitational waves would have to move at the speed of light. Even though Einstein, in his general theory of relativity(1915), shut down Poincaré's idea of gravitational waves, he kept working on his idea. "

While there were still many skeptics of gravitational waves during this time, physicists slowly begun to believe. "

By late 1970's all of Webers claims were debunked. "

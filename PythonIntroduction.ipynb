If we were doing this without a function, we have three essential portions of the calculation: \n - One defining the radius of the circle\n - One calculating the area from the radius\n - One printing the result of the calculation\n\nRecall the formula for area of a circle:\n$$a_{circle}=\\pi*r^2$$\n \nFor our calculation, we need to know two pieces of syntax we have not yet encountered.\n1. We get the value of pi from the library `math`, which can be accessed either from import statement or by writing `math.pi` as shown below.\n2. Powers can be calculated with the `**` operator, or alternatively with the method `math.pow`. **DO NOT USE the `^` operator.** That's a completely different binary operation and will give you a wrong answer.\n \nThis code might be done with one line or four, as shown below. That's up to personal preference and the particular needs of the program. "

You've seen classes before: `math` is a class, and it contains its own functions (like `pow()`) and variables (like `pi`). When a function is a part of a class, we call it a \"method.\"\n\nOften classes are defined with one Main Method that does all the work. These will be named as following:<br>\n`def __main__(self)`<br>\nThe underscores are a python convention, and just part of the name like any other character. The `self` is an extra parameter that must be included for any method in a class. \n\nA few more things about functions: it is possible to have functions without return values. We know these by void functions. A common void function would be ones that have a print statement in the body (like above). If you want good syntax, you should always return a blank statement (examples below). Another function we need to be aware of is `def main`. Its the function where all the important parts of the code are going on. More of this will be later. "

This is called a \"base case;\" if we didn't have it, the function would run forever and might crash the computer. For any number. a perfect place to put a stopping function. Now the else statement.

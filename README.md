# Gravitational-Wave-Toolkit

This set of Jupyter notebooks introduces the basics of Python and gravitational waves from LIGO data. Originally created for PHYS2500 students at Utah State University.

## Getting Started

#### Importing to Azure
1. Log in or sign up at [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/). If you have a Microsoft account for any other Microsoft product, that sign-in will work here.
2. Go to __My Projects__ in the top navigation bar. Click the button on the right-hand side of the screen labelled __Upload GitHub Repo__.
3. In the dialog that opens, enter the following link: 
   - https://github.com/melilly/Gravitational-Wave-Toolkit.git
4. Click __Import__ to create a new project with the files from this repository.

#### Navigating the Notebooks
The main files are labelled "#\_Title". Start with 1 and proceed through to 4. Sections 2, 3, and 4 depend on Section 1 OR prior knowledge of Python. Section 4 is more easily understood in the context of the information in Section 3. 

As you work through the notebooks, you will sometimes be referred to the other files in the repository. FunctionList.txt may be used as a reference to commonly used libraries and functions.

If we were doing this without a function, we have three essential portions of the calculation: \n - One defining the radius of the circle\n - One calculating the area from the radius\n - One printing the result of the calculation\n\nRecall the formula for area of a circle:\n$$a_{circle}=\\pi*r^2$$\n \nFor our calculation, we need to know two pieces of syntax we have not yet encountered.\n1. We get the value of pi from the library `math`, which can be accessed either from import statement or by writing `math.pi` as shown below.\n2. Powers can be calculated with the `**` operator, or alternatively with the method `math.pow`. **DO NOT USE the `^` operator.** That's a completely different binary operation and will give you an incorrect answer.\n \nThis code might be done with one line or four, as shown below. That's up to personal preference and the particular needs of the program. "

Since computers begin counting at zero and if s = 'try'\n- s[0] = t\n- s[1] = r\n- s[2] = y\n\nLastly, s[1 : len(s)] - 1 begins at 1 from len(s) (eliminating the first character we already tested), and shortens the length of the string by one (eliminates the last character we tested). If these are still confusing, skip down to 3.2 Lists for further clarification.\n\nWith these in mind, lets try explaing the code now. You try first.
